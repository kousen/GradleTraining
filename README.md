# Gradle Training

This repository contains materials from multiple sources. The `labs` module contains exercises from before they were recently revised. The zip file `intro_to_gradle_kotlin.zip` contains the exercises, solutions, and slides deck for that course.

The PDF file `Introduction to the Gradle Build Tool.pdf` is the revised set of materials. All the exercises for that module are located on GitHub, starting at [Gradle Build Tool Training Exercises](https://github.com/gradle/build-tool-training-exercises). Individual subprojects are linked below.

Background information on Gradle using the Groovy DSL can be found in my own set of [Gradle Materials](http://www.kousenit.com/gradle/).

Kotlin materials specifically designed for Android applications can be found at [Kotlin for Android](http://www.kousenit.com/kotlin-for-android/).

A really good, modern set of Kotlin training materials can be found on the Kotlin home page at [Teach Computer Science with Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/education/).

My set of Gradle slides can be found at [Gradle Concepts and Best Practices](https://www.dropbox.com/s/aeo1w6wq91s7hi9/Gradle%20Concepts%20and%20Best%20Practices.pdf?dl=0). (Since some people can't access DropBox links, those slides have also been added to this repository.)
